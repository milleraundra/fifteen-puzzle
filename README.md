# FifteenPuzzle
I grew up playing the Fifteen Puzzle that sat on my grandparent's desk. This will be a digital remake of that game.

Goals:
1. Game loads with pre-selected, standard solution. Tiles are shuffled.
2. One or multiple tiles can be moved in one turn.
3. Number of turns is totaled
4. You are notified when you have solved the puzzle.

Stretch Goals:
1. Game can be 'won' through a variety of solutions. Allow users to choose a pattern to solve the puzzle
2. Game looks and feels like the real-life game. Sounds, shadows, swiping/sliding, etc.
3. Dark/Light mode
4. Sound on/off
5. User can add name and submit total turns to a leaderboard (by pattern?)
6. PWA

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
